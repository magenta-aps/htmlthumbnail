        Get a named thumbnail for a content resource.<br/>
        The two URL templates which support a 'filename' template-arg are made available in order to
        support scenarios (e.g. with third party libraries) where the repo URL being called includes an explicit filename suffix.<br/>
        Note that Alfresco does not currently use the filename template-arg and that it will be ignored.
        Therefore a GET to these URLs will return the same resource as to the equivalent URLs without it.

        This script modifies the output such that a special script tag is
        included inside the &lt;head&gt; tag of the output HTML.
        This is to work around restrictions related to included this URL in
        an iframe when it is requested from another site.
        Note: The only supported thumbnailname is 'html'.
