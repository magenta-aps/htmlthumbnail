# htmlthumbnail
HTML thumbnail generation for Alfresco nodes. Registers a thumbnail type called "html" which will render an HTML 
rendition of an Alfresco node, if possible. Useful if you need HTML previews of nodes.

# Install

Just apply the AMP file to Alfresco generated by mvn package.

Implementation based on https://github.com/share-extras/media-viewers/

Two transformers are provided for this module transformation for excel to html to be able to handle embedded images in 
the resulting html file

1. pdf2htmlex - Complex pipeline via pdf (xlsx => pdf => html)
This depends on pdf2htmlEX (https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX) and as such requires this to be installed.
Use this script (https://gist.github.com/rajeevkannav/d07f822e209a22d07176) to install it on ubuntu >= 14.04.
Currently, it is nigh on impossible to install this on a CentOs < 7.0 distro due to python issues.

2. excel2html
This is a python script that uses a combination of LibreOffice and string substitution to replace the 'src' attribute
of the <img> tag in the resulting file. For this to work the following two variables need to be added to the 
alfresco-global.properties file:
        - python.exe=/usr/bin/python #(<= for example)
        - python.excel2html.script=/path/to/excel2html.py #Have to define this until we figure out a way to resolve the classpath variable

The first is the location of the python binary to use for the script execution.
The second is the location of the python script that will handle the conversion (inc calling LO), encoding of the png 
files, and string substitution
